        <p>Food! Food!! Food!!! From breakfast to dinner, we all look forward to an experience that satisfies our growling hunger and enriches our taste buds with something memorable. However, that excitement and passion for new varieties is largely left disappointed...</p>
        <p>UNTIL NOW! Here, you will find regional favorites across popular tourist spots of my liking. From the States in America to my homeland, India, you will be treated to a list of Must Try Entrées and Desserts. Hopefully this magnificant list leaves you drooling and motivated to explore more varieties around you and across national borders.</p>
        <p>This website has only recently been published in the past month. So I am still researching for new regional recipes to share. If you would like to recommend some of your personal favorites, look forward to the sharing dashboard that will soon be available! </p>
