        <img src="images/smores.jpeg" width = "200" alt="S'Mores" />
        <p>If you’re headed to North America for your summer holidays, one thing you’re bound to try is a s’more - particularly as National S’mores Day is celebrated every 10th of August! Said to be a contraction of the words ‘some’ and ‘more’, s’mores were first eaten around the campfire at Scout camps as far back as the 1920s. A s’more is made up of two biscuits sandwiched together with melted chocolate and marshmallows - traditionally melted over the campfire itself!</p>

        <h2>Lamingtons</h2>
        <h3>Australia</h3>
        <img src="images/lamingtons.jpeg" width = "200" alt="Lamingtons" />
        <p>Lamingtons are traditionally made from a small square of vanilla sponge covered in chocolate and desiccated coconut, but they can also contain a layer of jam sandwiching two lamington halves. Lamingtons are said to be named after Lord Lamington, who served as the Governor of Queensland in the late 1890s. The story goes that he had some unexpected guests, so his chef dipped leftover vanilla sponge cake in chocolate and coconut before serving them to the guests. This adds even more fuel to the fire that says the world’s best desserts are often created by accident!</p>

        <img src="images/baklava.jpeg" width = "200" alt="Baklava" />
        <p>No list of the world’s best sweets and desserts would be complete without baklava from the Middle East. It’s a sweet pudding, often served in restaurants at the end of a meal when you’re given the bill, but you can also order it from cafes as a mid-morning or afternoon snack. Baklava is made from layers of paper-thin filo pastry, butter, chopped nuts and a sweet syrup fragranced with rose or orange blossom water. It’s normally made in big tins, baked and then drizzled with even more syrup before cutting into smaller pieces.</p>
